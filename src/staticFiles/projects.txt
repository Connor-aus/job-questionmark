1. AI Agent for Professional Profile (Connor's assistant - the one handling this request)

This project is a serverless AI assistant built using LangChain and AWS Lambda. The assistant is designed to help users interact with Connor McSweeney’s professional profile by performing one of several predefined tasks. It behaves like an agentic AI, capable of using tools to process requests intelligently and return useful responses.

It can:
- Analyze how well Connor fits a specific job description
- Answer questions about Connor’s skills and experience
- Forward a contact message to Connor
- Explain how users can interact with it
