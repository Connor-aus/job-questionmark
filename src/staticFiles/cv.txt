Professional Experience:

KFC Global | Technical Architect		Remote (contract)   05/2024 - 05/2025
Contributed to the architecture and delivery of a global ecommerce platform serving 15M+ users/month across 6 countries, playing an integral role across requirements analysis, system design, implementation, and production support.
Reduced AWS operational costs by ~38% through a comprehensive audit and optimization of compute, networking, and storage resources.
Authored and implemented the organization-wide observability strategy, establishing standards for logging, monitoring, and alerting using Datadog, Sentry, Lumigo, and CloudWatch, improving visibility across distributed systems.
Played a key role in Datadog integration and configuration, enabling real-time monitoring and supporting 300+ production alerts/month, improving response accuracy, issue resolution speed, and SLA adherence.
Migrated runtime configuration management to AWS Parameter Store, replacing static pipeline variables with secure, dynamic runtime injection, eliminating the need for redeployments and improving agility across environments.
Diagnosed and remediated leading causes of failure in a microservice ecosystem, resulting in >80% reduction in system error rate and significantly improving stability.
Presented and executed a CDN strategy, onboarding all remaining hostnames to Akamai and deprecating legacy domains to improve global scalability and user-experience through reduced response times.
Implemented edge caching rules for high-traffic endpoints, reducing total CDN throughput by ~30%, lowering response latency and decreasing backend load.
Conducted root cause analyses (RCAs) of high-severity incidents, introducing architectural remediations that reduced MTTR and mitigated risk of recurrence.
Enforced architectural alignment with internal security policies, auditing backend APIs and driving remediation efforts to strengthen authentication and access control.
Engineered automation for common support operations, reducing manual effort and cutting mean time to resolution by >70%, improving SLA compliance.


SDSI | Full Stack Software Engineer		Brisbane, AUS    03/2022 - 04/2024
Engineered and launched STEMconnect, a cross-platform mobile application for emergency services, featuring SignalR-based real-time messaging, turn-by-turn navigation, and cloud-based auto-scaling/failover, supporting >4K concurrent users in critical response scenarios.
Designed and delivered STEMCollect, a .NET MAUI application hosted across Azure and on-prem infrastructure, enabling resilient data capture and integration with third-party healthcare systems.
Reduced data sync times by 80% by implementing efficient data batching.
Collaborated with third-party consultants and external stakeholders to lead technical integration, deliver architectural documentation, conduct training, and present product capabilities at the CAA Congress - strengthening adoption and building trust among healthcare and government partners.


Department of Education | Teacher		London, UK / Brisbane, AUS    01/2018 - 03/2022
