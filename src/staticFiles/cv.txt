Professional Experience:

KFC Global | Technical Architect		Remote (contract)   05/2024 - 05/2025
Summary: Architected and delivered scalable, serverless backend services and APIs on AWS (Node.js, Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.) for a global E-commerce platform (15M+ users/month). Led migration of legacy configuration to modern cloud-native patterns (AWS Parameter Store), implemented comprehensive observability (Datadog, Sentry, CloudWatch, Lumigo), and optimized performance and AWS infra cost. Collaborated cross-functionally to enhance system resilience, security, and user experience. Hands-on in CI/CD (GitLab), infrastructure as code, and automation of operational processes (Python).
- Contributed to the architecture and delivery of a global ecommerce platform serving 15M+ users/month across 6 countries, playing an integral role across requirements analysis, system design, implementation, and production support.
- Reduced AWS operational costs by ~38% through a comprehensive audit and optimization of compute, networking, and storage resources.
- Authored and implemented the organization-wide observability strategy, establishing standards for logging, monitoring, and alerting using Datadog, Sentry, Lumigo, and CloudWatch, improving visibility across distributed systems.
- Played a key role in Datadog integration and configuration, enabling real-time monitoring and supporting 300+ production alerts/month, improving response accuracy, issue resolution speed, and SLA adherence.
- Migrated runtime configuration management to AWS Parameter Store, replacing static pipeline variables with secure, dynamic runtime injection, eliminating the need for redeployments and improving agility across environments.
- Diagnosed and remediated leading causes of failure in a microservice ecosystem, resulting in >80% reduction in system error rate and significantly improving stability.
- Presented and executed a CDN strategy, onboarding all remaining hostnames to Akamai and deprecating legacy domains to improve global scalability and user-experience through reduced response times.
- Implemented edge caching rules for high-traffic endpoints, reducing total CDN throughput by ~30%, lowering response latency and decreasing backend load.
- Conducted root cause analyses (RCAs) of high-severity incidents, introducing architectural remediations that reduced MTTR and mitigated risk of recurrence.
- Enforced architectural alignment with internal security policies, auditing backend APIs and driving remediation efforts to strengthen authentication and access control.
- Engineered automation for common support operations, reducing manual effort and cutting mean time to resolution by >70%, improving SLA compliance.
